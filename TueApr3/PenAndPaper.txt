-- Step 1. Determine the above relationships are one to many or many to many.
OWNERS AND PETS
One to Many (Owners to pets). You can have multiple family members, but 
typically pets still have their "one" alpha person they obey
BLOG POSTS AND AUTHORS
One to Many (Author to blog post). You could have co-authors for some things
but I think with blogs, you're likely only going to have one author due to
brevity.

TEACHERS AND STUDENTS
student_taught_by_teacher
PARENTS AND CHILDREN
parent_has_child
CLASSES AND OBJECTS
class_used_for_object
PROJECTS AND CONTRIBUTORS
project_by_contributor
These are all Many to Many

--Step 2. Take just one of the above examples, draw some sample data.
--And do an inner join and then a left outer join.
Classes and Objects
Animal      Cat
Animal      Dog
Pet         Dog
Pet         Cat
Animal      Eagle
Pet         Rock
--          Couch
Plant       --
Show only objects that have a class (Cat, Dog, Eagle, Rock)
Show only classes that have no objects (Plant)
